        <h3>I love you</h3>

        <p>
          Some say "Love takes time", but the day I layed my eyes on you I could
          not shake off the image of the majestic beauty God has blessed you
          with.
          <br /><br />
          To say I love you is nothing but an understatement of what you mean to
          me. For the last month, you have been the core of everything that is
          good and beautiful in my life.
          <br /><br />
          Oh Misyam, I love you so much. I love you today, and I know I will
          love even more tomorrow.
